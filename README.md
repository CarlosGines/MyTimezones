# MyTimezones

Sample project created to serve as an example of my coding skills. There are 3 main modules:
- MyTimezonesAndroid: An Android client. I have already been working with Android for 2 years. It uses Clean Architecture.
- MyTimezonesBackend: A Node.js backend using Express.js and MongoDB. I have recently learned these technologies.
- MyTimezonesClient: An AngularJS most basic client. Just an alternative to test the requests manually (HTTP requests automated tests within backend).
